DATABASE MODIFICATIONS AND DETAILS

1. SOURCE

Downloaded the zip files from Stack Overflow - https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey

2. LOCATION ON THE LOCAL MACHINE

The data was not uploaded on the project because (in 2019) it is over 670 MB in size.

Create a data folder alongside(on the same level) the git folder.

In the data folder, create a folder for each year named in this way: developer_survey_2011 

In each developer_survey_2011 folder, rename the results .csv file to: survey_results_public.csv
Yes, these files have the same name, the folder that holds them is different.
